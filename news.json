london.\n    the 14th congress of the inter-arab cambiste association\nalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified gulf\ncurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.\n    foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these\nissues, and the slide of the lebanese pound, can be expected to\nbe major talking points.\n    about 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --\nincluding some in london and other major non-arab financial\ncentres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins\non on saturday.\n    bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a\ngrowing proportion of transactions in the saudi riyal market,\nby far the largest in the region, is being carried out in\nlondon.\n    the market had been dominated by saudi arabia's 11 banks,\nforeign exchange houses in the kingdom and offshore banks in\nbahrain. but bankers said more and more saudi and bahrain-based\nbanks are boosting their treasury operations in london.\n    as recession hit the middle east and the need for trade\nfinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in bahrain\nran down their currency operations. none of the four major u.k.\nclearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.\n    the two major bahrain-based international banks, \nbanking corp> and  have increased\ntheir presence in london and saudi banks are busy upgrading\nrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.\n    one economist said: \"it is cheaper to run a riyal book in\nlondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in bahrain...\nthere is now the nucleus of a two-way market in london.\"\n    jeddah-based  set up as a licensed deposit\ntaker in london in 1984, while its main rival in saudi arabia,\n (ncb) won a licence in november\n1986.\n    the major market maker has traditionally been london-based\nconsortium bank  but the kingdom\njoint-venture  (samba) also upgraded its\nlondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-february.\n    one senior currency trader in riyadh said: \"inevitably the\nvolume of business in london has gained pace with the two new\nlicences for ncb and samba, but there is no question that most\nof the liquidity still rests in saudi arabia.\"\n    currency traders said the shift to london in the saudi\nriyal market is difficult to quantify.\n    bahrain monetary agency figures show regional currency\ndeposits held by offshore banks, most in saudi riyals, dropped\nto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-september 1986\nfrom 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.\n    the shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. riyal\ntrading in the gulf on saturdays and sundays has become very\nquiet with london closed while some saudi and bahrain banks now\nstaff offices on friday, the gulf weekend. traders also expect\n to step up london operations.\n    traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\nmoving completely out of the region, partly because of local\ndemand and partly because of what is seen as the saudi arabian\nmonetary agency's (sama) desire to moderate\ninternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue\nspeculation.\n    there have been far fewer signs of the kuwaiti dinar market\nshifting from its natural base of kuwait and trading in bahrain\nand london is still limited.\n    but for the first time since the formation of the six\nnation gulf cooperation council (gcc) in 1981 there are signs\nthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.\n    currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final\ncurrency union would take for the six states -- saudi arabia,\nkuwait, bahrain, oman, qatar and the united arab emirates.\n    but plans to link the six currencies in a european monetary\nsystem style with a common peg have been discussed at high\nlevel and could be a topic on the gcc's annual summit expected\nto be held in saudi arabia late in the year.\n    one dealer said: \"a lot of exposure is being given to\ndiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. but in the\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\n    one open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\n    the idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\nsince the start of the gcc. the kuwaiti dinar is currently\nlinked to a basket of currencies while the other five\ncurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to the\nu.s. dollar.\n    some traders said a currency union could mean speculation\nagainst the saudi riyal rubbing off on other gulf currencies,\nbut plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of\n7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.\n    another topic for debate is expected to be the continued\nslide of the lebanese pound against the dollar and the\nundermining of the effective capital base of lebanese banks.\n reuter\n"

(and\nissue) excessive wage and bonus increases,\" he said.\n    failure to cut this excess will \"result in reduced\naccumulation of funds...and serve to corrupt social morality,\"\nzhao said. he said there was a contradiction between low per\ncapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.\n    china needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction\nin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption\nmust match the available resources, he said.\n    zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986\nbecause of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost\nof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income\nfrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.\n    local authorities, departments and firms have been able to\nretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. \"(they)\nunjustifiably developed processing industries and\nnon-productive construction,\" zhao said.\n    he said that unless effective measures are taken to curb\nthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely to\nincrease in the next few years.\n    zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last\ntoo long, they will cause the over-issue of money, which in\nturn will cause \"disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise in\ncommodity prices and chaos in economic life.\"\n    another serious problem is that too many new construction\nprojects have been launched. fixed asset investment outside the\nstate plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment\nis highly irrational, he said.\n    investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw\nand semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and\ninvestment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.\n     zhao said some departments and local authorities have\nfailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this\ninvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from the\nstate council earlier this year.\n     he said china's per capita output of grain and other farm\nand sideline products is still very low and production of\ngrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a\nrather weak foundation.\n     china's countryside is still in the development stage and\nthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, he\nsaid, but did not elaborate.\n    zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe\nlife into china's large and medium sized state firms, which\nstill do not have \"a satisfactory combination of\nresponsibilities, powers and benefits.\"\n    \"we have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises\nfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their own\nprofits and losses,\" he said.\n    currently, the firms are not responding rationally to\nmarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, he\nsaid. their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.\n    zhao said that in 1987, china will speed up the reform of\nits financial system, diversify credit services, encourage\ncompetition among different financial institutions and promote\ninsurance services.\n    he said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,\nwith differential and floating rates being applied for\ndifferent periods of time.\n    china must, under proper guidance, develop markets for the\ncirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of\nfinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.\n    zhao said china must also expand the market for capital\ngoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. the lack\nof such a market is the main reason why large state firms have\n\"yet to be fully invigorated,\" he said.\n    he also promised a continuation of the labour contract\nsystem under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period\nand pay them according to their own methods, subject only to\nstate-set ceilings for wages and bonuses.\n reuter\n"

  "body": "governments of major asian\nproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new\ninternational natural rubber agreement (inra), but growers and\ntraders are unhappy with the development, according to views\npolled by reuter correspondents.\n    officials in malaysia, indonesia and thailand, which\nproduce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the\nnew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber\nindustries remain viable in the long-term.\n    but traders and growers said they were against the new pact\nbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere\nwith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.\n    the new inra, to replace the current one which expires on\noctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's\nproducers and consumers in geneva last friday.\n    it will be open for signature at the u.n. headquarters in\nnew york from may 1 to december 31 this year and will enter\ninto force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting\nfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.\n    malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik said\nthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of\nliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of inra buffer stock rubber\nand a possible depression of prices.\n    he expressed confidence that the new inra would continue to\nkeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose\nor fell through its buffer stock system.\n    malaysia was also happy that in the new inra financing of\npurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a\ncontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done\nthrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.\n    under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to\nfinance inra's buffer stock purchases. this has been viewed\nwith concern by some members who fear the inra may become\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the international\ntin agreement.\n    \"this will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" lim said.\n     malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking\ncabinet approval to join the new inra and hoped other producers\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\n    officials in jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\nto indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.\n    it was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\n    thai officials told reuters they were optimistic the new\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\nthe inra buffer stock manager might commit to his market\noperations.\n     malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\nrubber market because an inra had a tendency to keep prices at\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\n    \"with the inra's ability to keep prices at a certain stable\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a malaysian\nrubber producers council source told reuters.\n    producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne inra buffer stock which had\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\n    state plantation officials in sri lanka said prices had\nbeen depressed since inra's inception and the creation of a\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\n    sri lanka should not be a member of the inra because it was\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\n    traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\nto produce more.\n    most malaysian and singapore traders said the new pact's\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\n    \"the 360,000 tonnes in the inra buffer stock must be\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a malaysian trader said.\n    japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\nto finance buffer stock operations.\n reuter\n"

  "body": "hong kong's government has long kept\nintervention in the economy to a minimum in the belief that\nwhen it comes to business, businessmen generally know best.\n    but the government is slowly being forced to take a more\nactive economic role, partly to face the challenge from fast\ngrowing economies like south korea and taiwan and economic\npowerhouse japan, businessmen said.\n    the government announced this month it will spend six mln\nh.k. dlrs over the next two years to encourage electronics\nfirms to send engineers for training overseas.\n    the engineers will learn design of application specific\nintegrated circuits (asic) used in products ranging from\npersonal computers to high-technology toys that talk.\n    the government has funded vocational training before but\nthis will be its first such program aimed at bringing back\nadvanced technology from overseas.\n    government officials told reuters that other areas in the\nelectronics sector are being considered for similar treatment.\n    hong kong's key electronics industry last year accounted\nfor exports of 61 billion h.k. dlrs, though the total includes\nsales of electrical machinery and other items.\n    officials said that this key sector, second only to\ntextiles in terms of exports, needs high technologies already\navailable in neighbouring economies if it is to compete.\n    \"belatedly, we realize there are some technologies which\ncan't be taught here,\" said k.y. yeung, director of industry.\n    a study by u.s. research firm dataquest inc last year\nshowed that hong kong's share of u.s. consumer electronic\nimports had fallen to 3.5 pct in 1985 from 6.4 pct in 1983.\n    south korea, taiwan and japan all take a more active role\nin guiding economic development and policy makers are worried\nthat perhaps some assistance -- albeit limited -- is needed.\n    \"this is perceived to be an area of development for hong\nkong,\" said lawrence mills, director-general of the federation\nof hong kong industries. \"many industrialists think government\nshould be more actively concerned with this area.\"\n    hong kong likes to call its policy \"positive\nnon-intervention,\" meaning that it helps industry mainly by\nmaintaining economic stability and ensuring that needed roads\nand harbour facilities are in place.\n    it offers no special tax incentives for foreign investors,\nbelieving that its low corporate profits tax of 18 pct and\npersonal income tax of 16.5 pct are sufficient.\n    but the government has been forced to gradually take a more\nactive role in the economy. in the last three years it has\nstepped in to aid seven problem banks, taking over three of\nthem, to protect depositors whose funds were not insured.\n    it has also expanded the powers of its banking and\nsecurities commissions to police these key economic sectors.\n    industry officials said manufacturers need help acquiring\nexpensive new technology, especially when returns on investment\nare years away. \"this is only a small start but it will help\nmake this technology more readily available,\" said an engineer\nwith a major u.s. electronics firm in hong kong.\n    texas instruments inc  and motorola inc  of the\nu.s. and japan's toshiba corp  already conduct asic\ndesign work in hong kong, while a handful of firms have\ncommitted funds for capital-intensive production.\n    under the industry department program, companies would be\nfunded to train engineers overseas but those employees would be\nrequired to apply their new skills locally for an as yet\nunspecified period.\n    \"we want to promote asic design and eventually production in\nhong kong,\" said yeung of the industry department.\n    some industrialists said it will take more than a training\nprogram to keep electronics manufacturers competitive in the\nyears ahead. government officials said most manufacturers in\nthe industry are small scale, employing fewer than 100 people.\n    these firms will not be able to afford expensive technology\ndevelopment programs, industry officials said.\n    the program has raised concerns that government may one day\nveer too far from its policy of minimal intervention. \"they've\nreached the right decision,\" said mills of the federation of\nindustries. \"but the fear (among some firms) is it might be a\nslippery slope towards interference.\"\n reuter\n"

  "body": "british banks are resisting signing a 76\nbillion dlr rescheduling package for mexico in a last ditch\neffort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new\n7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.\n    christopher brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,\nat lloyds bank plc, said in response to a reuter enquiry, that\nthe six major u.k. clearing banks last week sent a telex to\ncitibank saying they would contribute what was requested\nprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the u.s.\nbanks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by\nthem.\n    other bankers, who declined to be identified, said other\ngroups of banks particularly those in switzerland, france and\ncanada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had not\nsent any telex to citibank, which chairs mexico's 13-bank\nadvisory group.\n    however, they said it was likely that if and when the\nbritish banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.\n    under the agreement, for which the signing began on friday,\ncommercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct of\ntheir exposure to mexico as of august 1982. that was the date\nof the first mexican debt crisis.\n    after months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement\nfor mexico was struck last september during the annual meeting\nof the world bank and international monetary fund in\nwashington.\n    ever since then the advisory group, of which lloyds is a\nmember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.\n    however, there has been considerable resistance to the\npackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and\npartly because many small u.s. regional banks do not want to\nincrease their exposure to any latin american countries.\n    brougham said, \"we (british banks) have always played along\nfor mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.\"\n    the decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six\nclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.\n    in addition to lloyds, telexes were sent by national\nwestminster bank plc, barclays bank plc, midland bank plc,\n\n    brougham noted that so far the u.s. banks have only reached\n83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the\nlevel of contributions from the u.k. banks is well in excess of\n90 pct. \"the u.s. figure should be closer to ours,\" he said.\n    many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the\nregional u.s. banks, noting that even if they don't contribute\nto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the\nexisting loans.\n    the banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and\nbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.\n    in the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be\nexercised on the regional banks and the major u.s. banks to\nfind a solution to the problem. many have suggested that the\nlarger u.s. banks should take on the additional obligations,\nbut so far they have resisted this.\n    bankers expect that much of the pressure on the u.s. banks\nwill come from u.s. regulators, notably the federal reserve.\n    bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the british\nbanks and other national groups as \"a matter of principal, and\nburden sharing\" rather than as a \"pressure tactic\" to force the\nu.s. banks to make up their share.\n    the bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the\nprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.\n    the mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. at\nthe signing in new york last friday, finance minister gustavo\npetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.\n    \"those who supported us today can be sure that mexico will\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\nopportunities which its future growth will create,\" petricioli\nsaid.\n    conversion of bank debt into equity investments in mexico\nis one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their\nexposure. but mexico halted its debt for equity program in\nfebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.\n    on friday, petricioli said \"we will be a lot more\nexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that have\nsupported us.\"\n    the pressure on the u.s. banks comes at a time when other\nmajor latin american debtors are in the process of crucial debt\nnegotiations.\n    brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all\ninterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. many\nof the major u.s. banks, including citibank, have already said\nthey might have to put their brazil loans on a cash basis and\ntake the financial losses, which could total billions of\ndollars.\n    this would be required by u.s. banking regulations if the\ninterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.\n    however, the u.s. banks are not the only ones threatened by\nregulations. in the u.k., a proposed inland revenue ruling\nwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many\nof which are made to latin american countries.\n    basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank\ncan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan\ninterest payments.\n    the british banks are planning to fight the proposals as\ntheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in\nterms of compliance but in limiting future business.\n reuter\n"

  "body": "less than two months after first\ninterstate bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy bankamerica\ncorp, chairman joseph pinola is still looking for a good buy,\nbut he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.\n    in a wide-ranging interview, pinola said he's looking for\nways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,\n\"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our\nindependence, if possible.\"\n    in 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major\neast coast banks to buy banks in california.\n    first interstate, the fourth largest california bank, and\nthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western\nstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.\n    bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for\nlarge u.s. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the \nlucrative california market and the west coast region.\n    while declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when\nasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, pinola replied,\n\"that's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive\nnot to think that.\"\n    pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as\n\"opportunistic\".\n    he said he will look for banks in management trouble that\nhe can get at a bargain, then add management to restore\nprofitability, or for banks in states where first interstate\nalready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.\n    the exception, he said, would be texas, where he said most\nof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased\nat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.\n    pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move\nhim to rekindle his bid for bankamerica, saying only, \"we\ncontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of\npeople continue to monitor and look at us.\"\n    banking analysts, however, consider another first\ninterstate bid at bankamerica a long shot, not likely to happen\nany time soon.\n    pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25\nbillion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, \"a very,\nvery difficult decision.\"\n    with that decision made, however, he acknowledged first\ninterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number\nfour position in the california banking community.\n    \"the competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting\ncitybank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches\nfrom sears roebuck company. \"citybank is moving rapidly to move\nus down to fifth and wells fargo down to fourth,\" he said.\n    outside california, pinola acknowledged that security\npacific corp, with its recent acquisitions in arizona,\nwashington and oregon, is quickly becoming a regional\ncompetitor in areas where first interstate has long dominated.\n    \"security is, has been and continues to be a highly\nprofitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.\n    he added, however, first interstate, at the moment, has the\nadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer\nand has the recognition advantage of having given its regional\nbanks a common name.\n    pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good\nfinancial condition, first interstate continues to sustain\nserious loan losses in its rocky mountain states, where energy,\nreal estate and agriculture dominate the economy.\n    asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,\nhe said, \"i don't think it has bottomed out, because i think\nmost of the problems are real estate-related and the real\nestate problems are going to be with us for several years.\"\n    pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in\nthe midwest, has slowed expansion of first interstate's\nfranchise operation.\n    first interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer first\ninterstate financial services in ten states.\n    while a year ago he was considering taking his franchise\noperation east of the mississippi river, pinola said because\nmost of the franchise banks are now in the west, expansion into\nthe midwest must come first.\n    calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\"\npinola said, \"it is going to take a rejuvenation of the\nagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed\nwe were generating before the last year or two.\"\n    on the banking industry in general, pinola said he thinks\n1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks\nwith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.\n reuter\n"

  "title": "brazil's debt crisis becoming political crisis",
  "body": "brazil's financial crisis is rapidly\nbecoming a political and social crisis, and president jose\nsarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future.\n    as brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the united\nstates this week, political analysts say sarney's\nadministration has never appeared weaker.\n    the full political price which sarney will have to pay for\nthe failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation cruzado plan is\nstill not clear. he might have to pay with the presidency.\n    calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to\npick a successor to sarney early next year. the length of his\nterm will be decided by a constituent assembly, and sarney has\nbeen lobbying for a six-year term.\n    sarney came to power, without facing presidential\nelections, in march 1985, when the military bowed out after 21\nyears of rule.\n    although there was wide public support for direct \nelections for president, the military as one of their last\nacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more\ninfluence, make the choice.\n    the college chose tancredo neves, a popular politician who\nheaded the brazilian democratic movement party (pmdb), which\nhad opposed military rule.\n    in part to smooth relations with the military, neves chose\nsarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial\npost of vice-president. but neves died before he could take\noffice and sarney took power.\n    he won the grudging support of the pmdb and the cruzado\nplan was wildly popular with inflation-weary brazilians.\n    but the cruzado plan failed and politics in brazil has not\nbeen the same.\n    \"the country is a rudderless ship,\" said a u.s. diplomat,\nechoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea\nof how to tackle the economic crisis.\n    sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism\ncoming from the business community, the trade unions, some of\nthe military, the media and political opponents.\n    many businessmen are unhappy with sarney's decision\nannounced on february 20 to suspend interest payments on 68\nbillion dlrs of foreign debt.\n    a motor industry executive said: \"the business community\nthinks brazil should go to the imf. their rules are sometimes\nharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in\norder.\"\n    trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but\ndisagree with other aspects of government policy. since the end\nof february they have organized national strikes of seamen,\nbankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local\nstoppages and protests.\n    economic problems have prompted criticism from some\nmilitary figures, including the last army ruler, general joao\nfigueiredo. it is a sign of the times that almost daily\nmilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.\n    if the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of\nsarney's fate will be the pmdb's leaders. so far, they have not\ntaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.\n    but one pmdb leader, senator affonso camargo, pointedly\nsaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the\nconsituent assembly to call direct elections for the presidency\nwhenever it wished.\n    in the media, sarney has to contend with strong criticism.\n    one senior political commentator, fernando pedreira of the\njornal do brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:\n    \"president sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it\nis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state\nof the country and the people since the immense failure of the\ncruzado plan.\n    \"the disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the\nenticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too\nprofound.\"he called for direct elections early in 1988 as the\nonly way out of the present crisis.\n    one of sao paulo's leading news magazines, senhor, said in\nan editorial this week: \"the anarcho-populist government of\npresident jose sarney has failed. two years have already been\ntoo long for such a disastrous experience.\n    \"it deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. the\nnatural solution: direct elections soon.\"\n    the government's inability to control inflation is now\nbringing with it serious social problems.\n    an explosion in rents in sao paulo has thrown tens of\nthousands of families onto the streets because they can no\nlonger afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.\n    the local press says the city is experiencing the biggest\nwave of land invasions in its history.\n   according to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct\nin little more than a year. even the cheapest shacks now cost\n2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the\nminimum wage, which is all that many earn.\n    cardinal paulo evaristo arns, the roman catholic archbishop\nof sao paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of \"a social\nconflict of unimaginable proportions.\"\n    with his back to the wall politically and with social\ntensions rising, sarney is no position to compromise on debt.\n

  "body": "the state of texas, faced with a record\n5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may\nhave to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.\n     such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when\nthe state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily\nallowed texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate\nincome tax.\n     however, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only\nsent the texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into\nthe state's tax revenues.\n    both moody's investor services and standard and poor's cut\ntheir credit ratings of the state to double a from the top\ntriple a in early march.\n    moody's vice president george w. leung said it was the\nfirst time texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding\nthe report noted that while \"the legislature is now considering\nproposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for\nfull recovery are weak.\"\n    with only a slight improvement in the economy seen by state\ncomptroller bob bullock, the texas legislature must grapple\nwith a one billion dlr deficit by august 31 and another 4.8\nbillion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. no other\nstate in u.s. history has faced such a deficit.\n    \"there is a strong independent streak in texans and five\nyears ago i would never have dreamed the state legislature\nwould institute an income tax,\" said george bland, assistant\nprofessor of political science at north texas state university,\nadding, \"now my contacts at the legislature tell me it's\ncoming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time.\"\n     state taxes on oil and gas production traditionally\nsupplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.\n    however, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent\nyears, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence\non sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.\n     bland said he believes the tax reform act will be a major\nfactor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are\nno longer deductible from federal income tax while state income\ntax is.\n    john kennedy, senior research associate at the austin-based\ntexas research league said, \"there is a great deal of popular\nsentiment against it, plus the first plank of governor\nclements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax.\"\n    however, he said that since the oil price fall the state\nfaced a choice of either instituting an income tax or\nbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.\n    steve pejovich, director of the center for free enterprise\nat texas a and m university and an opponent of income taxes,\nsaid he favored reforming the present tax system to take\naccount of the changed structure of the economy.\n    \"we should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil\nand agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,\nmanufacturing and high-tech,\" pejovich said.\n    tony proffitt, an aide to state comptroller bob bullock\nsaid, \"bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the\nlegislature that if they get tired of looking at everything\nelse, that's the only option.\"\n    apart from texas, states which have no individual income\ntax are alaska, florida, nevada, new hampshire, south dakota,\nwashington and wyoming \n    for the time being, attorney general jim mattox has ruled\nthat the legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr\ndeficit into the next biennium, even though the state\nconsitution requires a balanced budget. but as state treasurer\nann richards said last thursday, \"jim mattox's decision today\nturns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not\nthink that the goose isn't still cooking.\"\n    opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending\ncuts. but the state is already under pressure from a federal\ndistrict court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or\nface 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.\n    and u.s. education secretary william bennett has accused\nthe state, among others, of lax education reform. earlier this\nyear, both houses of the legislature, citing financial\nrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning\nplans to require teachers to take competency tests.\n    bland said he believes the state will set up a commission\nnext year to \"study alternative revenue sources,\" with an\nincome tax being instituted as early as january 1989.\n    \"if the political leaders are educated about (the effects\nof the tax reform act), i think there will be a gradual drift\ntoward income tax,\" he said.\n                \n reuter\n"

  "body": "australian markets are booming as foreign\nfund managers redirect capital away from the united states and\nother traditional markets, analysts said.\n    high short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\nan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\nfresh funds in the last two months, largely from japanese and\nu.s. investors, analysts polled by reuters said.\n    fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\nand have settled on australia, britain and canada as they\ndiversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments, they said.\n    a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\nthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\ncurrency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n    official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\nare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\ninquiries from japan and the united states.\n    \"these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\nand they don't know what to do with it. some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\" national australia bank ltd\neconomist brian hamley said.\n    \"there is a 'flight to quality',\" hamley said. \"australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\nmany other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n    the stronger australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the u.s. unit, analysts said.\n    \"we're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the u.s.\nwhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nu.s. dollar,\" lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose\nsaid. \"why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\"\n    but turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \"it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\" buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\neconomic statement on may 14.\n    while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \"it will remain very edgy money. if something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\" buttrose said.\n    offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \"they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\" buttrose said.\n    reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in australia and the need to shield\njapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\nthe yen\" because of the crucial role of japanese investors.\n    analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar, the\naustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\naustralian share market. it has followed wall street and other\nmarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\nweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\nequities, particularly in the gold sector.\n    the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\ntoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\nthe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\nsame period.\n    the property sector is also sought after, with japanese\ncompanies that have invested heavily in the united states in\nrecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\nestate, particularly in the tourism field.\n    analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney's five-star\nregent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\nas indicative of the type of property being sought.\n    \"they think they find good value real estate here which,\nwith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\ninvestment australia needs,\" buttrose added.\n reuter\n"

  "body": "kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden\neconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\nwill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\nsay.\n    crucial will be the ability of the 13-member opec to hold\noil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n    bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\ndomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\nafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n    this was after taking into account inflation in consumer\nprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n    factors depressing economic activity include the\n6-1/2-year-old iran-iraq war on kuwait's doorstep, which\nthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the\ngulf and has sapped business confidence.\n    but sentiment received a much-needed boost in september\nwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\ncaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\nnew debt settlement program was introduced.\n    the share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\ntrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n    the cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\nspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n    much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\nstill owed by individuals and companies.\n    there was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\nin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\none-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\nbad or doubtful debt. but the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    the new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    kuwait is better placed than any other opec country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    kuwait has an opec quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by oil minister sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah.\n    but strategic diversification into downstream operations in\neurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    oil industry sources say kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    external accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\ngulf.\n    kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    but for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending june 30, bankers say.\n    in a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    this left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \"it depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"this summer is\nimportant.\"\n    cabinet affairs minister rashid al-rashid said last sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    he gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in june.\n reuter\n"
